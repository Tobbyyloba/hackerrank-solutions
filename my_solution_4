#Question:
#Consider a list (list = []). You can perform the following commands:

#insert i e: Insert integer e at position i. 
#print: Print the list.
#remove e: Delete the first occurrence of integer e. 
#append e: Insert integer  at the end of the list.
#sort: Sort the list.
#pop: Pop the last element from the list.
#reverse: Reverse the list.
#Initialize your list and read in the value of n followed by n lines of commands where each command will be of the 7 types listed above. Iterate through each command in order and #perform the corresponding operation on your list.
